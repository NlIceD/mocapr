\description{
Import_Captury() takes the filepath and filename of a .csv file containg motion capture data captured and exported using the CapturyLive motion capture system. The
.csv file is then imported and cleaned and returned as a tibble. All joint angles and global joint center positions are in abreviated names (e.g. left knee flexion =
LKF, global Y coordinate of the right hip joint is RHY).\cr
Please see the GitHub README.me for a more detailed description.

\section{Note}{

This function imports Captury .csv files as they are exported from CapturyLive version 0.0.168 and earlier. Newer versions have a different layout
and should be imported using \code{import_captury_csv()}.
