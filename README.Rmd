```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The goal of `mocapr` is to provide researchers or clinicians with R functions that can import, plot, animate, and analyse motion capture data. The package is in **the very early experimental stages of development** and is only **minimally effective** in the sense that it, currently, only supports import from [the Captury](http://thecaptury.com/) system.  

It should be possible to wrangle motion capture data from other systems into a format that will allow useage of the functions in this package, as long as the data contains frame by frame joint center positions. If you have such motion capture data from other systems, and if you are willing to share some sample data, I will be happy to make an attempt at writing an import function and include both the function and the sample data in this package. 

`mocapr` uses a series of tidyverse packages to import ([`readr`](https://github.com/tidyverse/readr), [`tidyr`](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr), [`dplyr`](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr), [`stringr`](https://github.com/tidyverse/stringr), [`forcats`](https://github.com/tidyverse/forcats)), plot ([`ggplot2`](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2)), animate ([`gganimate`](https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate)), and analyse motion capture data.  
The package also contains a sample data set `mocapr_data` which is generated using some of the above packages as well as [`purrr`](https://github.com/tidyverse/purrr).

While all functions should run without loading other libraries I strongly recommend you load the tidyverse `library(tidyverse)` prior to loading the mocapr library.

This is my first R package. I am sure I have much to learn in this area, but I am less sure of what it is I actually need to learn. Feedback and suggestions for improvement and future developments are **most welcome**. 

## Short on the story behind the package
I am a Ph.d. student at The Department of Sports Science and Clinical Biomechanics, Faculty of Health Sciences at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU). My work is a part of the project “Motor Skills in Pre-Schoolers”([MiPS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5576290/)), which is led by Lise Hestbæk.  
In MiPS we follow a cohort of \~950 pre-school children with yearly follow-ups. At each follow-up we collect data using markerless motion capture of the children as they perform a series of jumps and squats. My Ph.d. project revolves around collecting and analyzing this motion capture data, and the code available in this package is a more general form of some of the code I have written so far for use in this project. My initial attempts at approaching the data were made in Stata, but my work significantly picked up speed after I was introduced to R in the summer of 2017, and especially after I discovered the Tidyverse.

I have found R to be completely capable of working with large amounts of motion capture data, and I hope this package can, at least, serve as an inspiration as to how R can be utilized outside of statistics.

## Installation
`mocapr` can  be installed directly from github using devtools:

```{r installation, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('steenharsted/mocapr')
```
### Core Functions
`mocapr` contains 6 core functions and some sample data `mocapr_data`.
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Core Functions

```

### Intended workflow using the `mocapr` package 
![Intended Workflow Using the `mocapr` package](figures/Intended_Workflow.png)

### The Sample Data `mocapr_data`
`mocapr_data` consists of `r length(unique(mocapr::mocapr_data$movement_nr))` movements, each supplied with a number (`movement_nr`) and a short description (`movement_description`). Videos of the movements with an overlay of the track is available at this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMjrjny4Ymmd1nSGHU0A6dWfEWjBxc-VQ). The videoes are made using the CapturyLive software.

The data is also available as raw exports in .csv format, and can be found in the folder "data-raw".

Lets load `mocapr` and inspect the `mocapr_data`:  
```{r load_packages_show_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(mocapr)

#Data
mocapr_data %>% 
  group_by(movement_nr, movement_description) %>% 
  nest()
```

The format of the data is wide and contains frame by frame joint angles and global joint center positions. Therefore, each joint is typically represented by 6 columns (3 angles and 3 positions). To prevent long repetitve colomn names, all joint related variables are abbreviated according to their side (L|R), joint(A|K|H|S|E|W), and angle|position.    

| Side    | Joint        |Angle/Position |
| :---    | :---         | :---          |    
|         | A  (Ankle)   |F  (Flexion)   |
|L (left) | K  (Knee)    |Varus          |
|         | H  (Hip)     |DF (Dorsi Flexion)|
|R (Right)| W  (Wrist)   |X  (joint center position on the global X axis (floor)|
|         | E  (Elbow)   |Y  (joint center position on the global Y axis)(up)|
|         | S  (Shoulder)|Z  (joint center position on the global Z axis)(floor)|


Example for left knee:

| Abbreviated Variable Name | Meaning of abbreviation |
| :---:        |     :---:      | 
|LKF | Left Knee Flexion | 
|LKX | Left Knee joint center position on the X axis (floor plane) | 


The focus of this tutorial is on plotting and animating motion capture data. For this we only need the joint center positions. I will not discuss the joint angles further, but feel free to explore them on your own.


## Animating Motion Capture Data With `mocapr`
Lets first create some sample data:
```{r create_data}
jump_1 <- mocapr::mocapr_data %>% 
  filter(movement_nr == 1)

jump_2 <- mocapr::mocapr_data %>% 
  filter(movement_nr == 2)

gait <-  mocapr::mocapr_data %>% 
  filter(movement_nr == 4)

capoeira <- mocapr::mocapr_data %>% 
  filter(movement_nr == 6)
```

### Animating with `animate_global()`
The global coordinate system refers to a 3D coordinate system (X, Y, and Z axis) that is created and oriented during the setup and calibration of many motion capture systems. Global joint center positions refer to the position of a given joint center inside the global coordinate system.  
The `animate_global()` function animates the subject using the global joint center positions. It creates two animations: one in the X and Y plane; and one in the Z and Y plane. If the subject is moving along either the X or the Y axis the viewpoints will essentially be a side view and a front|back view.  
```{r jump_1_GP}
jump_1 %>% 
  animate_global(nframes = nrow(.), fps = 50)
```

If the recorded subject moves at an angle to the axis' of the global coordinate system, animations and plots using global joint center positions will have oblique viewpoints. When I performed `jump_2` I both simulated a poor landing on the right knee and made sure that the direction of the jump was oblique to the axis' in the global coordinate system. Therefore, using the `animate_global()` function on `jump_2` produces an animation with oblique viewpoints.
```{r jump_2_GP}
jump_2 %>% 
  animate_global(nframes = nrow(.), fps = 50)
```

### Animating with `animate_movement()` and `animate_anatomical()`
In many cases, out of axis movement and oblique viewpoints are easy to prevent. In these cases the `animate_global()` function might be sufficient, but in other cases, such as working with with pre-school children, out of axis movement is difficult to prevent without interfering in the spontaneous movements of the subject. Oblique viewpoints may also stem from differences in the orientation of the global coordinate system between motion capture systems or between different setups of the same motion-capture system.
  
For the purpose of analyzing or interpreting motions, oblique viewpoints are, in general, less optimal. This creates a need for animation and plotting functions that are free from the orientation of the global coordinate system, and instead focused on either the subject itself or the direction of the movement the subject is performing.
`mocapr` solves this challenge by providing two functions that projects the global joint center positions onto the planes of the movement direction (`project_full_body_to_MP()`) or the anatomical planes the subject (`project_full_body_to_AP()`). You can think of these functions as functions that creates new coordinate systems that are just **shifted/tilted** version of the global coordinate system, such that animations that use the joint center positions in the new coordinate systems will have viewpoints that are directly in front of and to the side of the direction of the movement (`animate_movement()`) or the person (`animate_anatomical()`).

The direction of the movement is determined by the position of the subject at the first and the last frame of the recording.

These functions are best explained by looking at animations.

Lets look again at `jump_2` (the jump that is oblique to the global coordinate system), and animate the jump using the `animate_movement()` and the `animate_anatomical()` functions.
```{r jump_2_MP}
jump_2 %>%
  #Project to the movements planes
  project_full_body_to_MP() %>%
  #Animate the movement plane projections
  animate_movement(nframes = nrow(.), fps = 50, rewind = FALSE)
```

```{r jump_2_AP}
jump_2 %>% 
  #Project to the anatomical Planes 
  project_full_body_to_AP() %>% 
  #Animate the anatomical projections
  animate_anatomical(nframes = nrow(.), fps = 50, rewind = FALSE)
```

*note: the right side appears on the right side in the anatomical animation and on the left side in the movement animation, this is intentional but might change in future versions*. 

Besides the size difference the two animations are very similar. This is because the movement that the subject is performing is uni-directional. For movements where the subject is moving in one direction with limited rotation of the pelvis (such as walking in a straight line, or jumping using both legs) the two projections and the following animations will produce similar results, but the results will differ greatly if the direction of the movement changes throughout the recording.   
 
Lets explore the difference between the two types of projections by looking at a movement that is not unidirectional.  

#### animate_movement()  
```{r walking_square_MP}
gait %>%
  #Project to the movements planes
  project_full_body_to_MP() %>%
  #Animate the movement plane projections
  animate_movement(nframes = nrow(.), fps = 50)
```

#### animate_anatomical()  
```{r walking_square_AP}
gait %>% 
  #Project to the anatomical Planes 
  project_full_body_to_AP() %>% 
  #Animate the anatomical projections
  animate_anatomical(nframes = nrow(.), fps = 50)
```

Now the difference between the two types of animations is evident. `animate_movement()` gives you *fixed viewpoints* (you are standing still and watching the movement) and `animate_anatomical()` *updates your viewpoint for each frame* (you are always the watching the subject from the back and the side of the pelvis).


## using `mocapr` to plot
The three animate functions can be used to plot if you supply the argument `animate = FALSE`. In that case the you will get a plot that is faceted on the frames. I suggest you reduce the number of frames before you use the functions to plot.

```{r show_how_to_plot}
jump_2 %>% 
  project_full_body_to_AP() %>% 
  filter( frame == 120 | frame == 150 | frame == 165 | frame == 170) %>% 
  animate_anatomical(animate = FALSE)
```


## Options
the width and height arguments can be used to specify width and height
I find slow-mo effects is best achieved by adding more rows, e.g., `nrow(.)*2`
```{r show_options}
capoeira %>% 
  filter(frame > 48 & frame < 223) %>% 
  project_full_body_to_MP() %>% 
  animate_movement(nframes = nrow(.)*2, fps = 50, width = 600, height = 600)
```
